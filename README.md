Hi there! My name is Mihailo and I'm currently working on my Ph.D in philosophy. 
I have a strong background in theoretical sciences and concepts, 
and I'm always looking for ways to put my skills and knowledge to good use. 
I'm interested in web development, especially when it comes to education and academia-related projects. 
I want to help bridge the gap between academia, IT technology, and end users like students, professors, and lifelong learners. 
I'm excited to be a part of the GitHub community and I'm looking forward to learning from others and making some meaningful contributions along the way!
